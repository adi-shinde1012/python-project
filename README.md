# Python-Project
## Objective
The primary objective of a voice assistant Python project is to develop an intelligent system that can interact with users through natural language. This assistant should be capable of understanding voice commands, performing tasks, retrieving information, and providing responses in a human-like manner, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

## Key Features:
### 1)Speech Recognition
### 2)Natural Language Processing (NLP)
### 3)Voice Response
### 4)Information Retrieval
# Voice Assistant Project

### This project is a Python-based voice assistant that can perform various tasks such as opening websites, telling the time, and more based on voice commands.

## How It Works

The voice assistant works through a series of steps involving speech recognition, natural language processing, task execution, and text-to-speech. Here's a visual representation of the workflow:
